## FAQ

#### Is this secure?

**Yes!** LxCrypt uses [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) with a 256-bit key and [RSA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>) with a 4096-bit key. Both of those algorithms are considered very safe.

#### What happens if I forget my password?

Because we encrypt your private key with this password and only store it on your machine,¬†**there is no way for us to decrypt the private key for you**. Sadly, this means that you will have to reset the application and that you won't be able to decrypt any messages that were sent to you before the reset.

#### Is any data sent to your server?

**No!** Everything regarding the encryption is done locally. The only thing that is stored online is your _public_ key. But as the name already hints, it's supposed to be public :)

#### Why should I trust you?

You shouldn't trust anybody, which is why **I made this project completely open-source**. This means you can view the code yourself. The full project code is published in this GitHub repository!

## Detailed technical explanation

_Please note that this is advanced, and you don't have to understand it to use the software!_

LxCrypt uses a technology called hybrid-encryption with AES and RSA.
Here are two images showing how it's implemented in LxCrypt.
